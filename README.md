<h1>
👋 Hi There! 
</h1>
As a game client developer, I am always trying to improve performance by thinking about various aspects such as resource management, updates, and memory optimization. Recently, I am very interested in and researching DOTS technology from Unity, and I have applied it in previous projects.
<br><br>
In addition, we are creating and applying new ideas to add creativity to the project. We are currently exploring the possibility of integration with other technologies and working to improve the overall system architecture.
